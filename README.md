# InfiniTD

This is the frontend for InfiniTD: an incremental, multiplayer tower defense game. The hosted version is available at https://infinitd.rofer.me/. The backend can be found at https://github.com/rhofour/InfiniTDBackend.

The code is written Angular using Typescript and is currently poorly unit-tested.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production docs
There is some documentation about the production setup available in [production/PROD_SETUP.md](production/PROD_SETUP.md).
