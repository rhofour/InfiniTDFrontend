<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    InfiniTD is an open-source web game provided at no cost and is intended
    for use as is. This policy describes how the game collects and uses user
    information. Your information will not be shared with anyone except as
    described in this Privacy policy.
</p>
<h2>What We Collect and How We Use It</h2>
<p>
    InfiniTD collects three kinds of data: <b>login data</b>, <b>game
    data</b>, and <b>logs</b>.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Login data</b> is the minimal necessary data to allow users to login
    through our third-party authentication providers. This is handled by the
    third party Firebase Authentication API and may include an identifier
    such as an email address. <u>This data is used solely for authentication and
    will not be shared unless legally required.</u>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Game data</b> is the data generated from interacting with the game
    such as username, tower placement, and gold. It is connected to the login
    data only through a pseudononymous user identifier. <u>This data is
    necessarily exposed publicly by the game for normal functioning.</u>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Logs</b> include both the <b>game backend logs</b> and
    <b>infrastructure logs</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The <b>game backend logs</b> consist of game data and data derived from
    interaction with the game. This is used to improve the game (such as
    identifying and fixing bugs). <u>Game backend logs are currently publicly
    exposed.</u>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Infrastructure logs</b> include the system logs of the machine the game is
    running on as well as the logs of HTTP server and logs from other
    necessary software for the game’s operation. This data may include your
    device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser version, operating
    system, and time of use. <u>These logs are only used for improving the game
    and will not be share unless legally required.</u>
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
    All login and game data may be deleted by deleting your account from the
    account page. This will not delete any data stored in the logs.
</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised
    to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of
    any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes
    are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
